name: compound
description: Turn what went wrong (or was learned) in the task just finished into a permanent guard, so the next task cannot repeat it. Use as the last step of every task before opening the PR — after the reviewer's verdict — and whenever Joseph corrects you. Part of the /build-task loop.

# Compound: every mistake becomes a guard

Same step as in `valuedocs` and `culvert`. A task is not finished when it works. It is finished when the next task is
easier. This step is short: usually one small addition, sometimes nothing. It is never skipped silently.

## 1. Collect the lessons of this task
From this session only, list each of:
- every **reviewer finding** (BLOCKER/MAJOR/MINOR, UNVERIFIED usage, missing test);
- every **hook failure** (Spotless, compile, syntax) or `mvn -B verify` failure (Checkstyle, Enforcer, JaCoCo, an IT) that took more than one attempt;
- every **wrong assumption**: an API, flag or version you had to correct after reading the docs;
- every **correction from Joseph** in this session;
- anything that took **3 attempts** or ended BLOCKED.

## 2. For each lesson, pick the strongest guard that fits, in this order
1. **A test, or an existing guard test extended.** Candidates: a capability test run against every
   adapter, an architecture test that keeps cloud SDKs out of `test-core`, a Checkstyle rule, a raised
   JaCoCo floor. This makes the lesson impossible to repeat. Prove it RED first.
2. **A hook check** in `.claude/hooks/`, if a fast mechanical check would have caught it at
   edit time. Add its case to `test-hooks.sh`.
3. **A reviewer checklist line** in `.claude/agents/reviewer.md`, if only judgement catches it.
4. **A pinned doc URL** in CLAUDE.md § "Pinned docs", if you had to search for the right doc.
5. **A CLAUDE.md rule**, as a last resort because prose is the weakest guard. One or two lines, in the section it belongs to
   with the date and the issue or PR number.
Skip a lesson only if an existing guard already covers it, and name that guard.

## 3. Keep the guards lean
- Before adding a CLAUDE.md line, grep for an existing rule that says the same thing. Sharpen that rule
  rather than adding a second one. Delete any rule this lesson proves wrong.
- A guard that changes process (reviewer, hooks, CLAUDE.md) goes in the **same PR** as the fix
  when it is small. Otherwise it gets its own PR titled `compound: …`.

## 4. Record it
Add a `## Compound` section to the PR body: `lesson → guard added (file:line)` per lesson, or
`none — <why>` if the task went clean. `/groom` counts these, so Joseph can see the system getting
stricter over time.
